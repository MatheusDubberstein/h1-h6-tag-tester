### Building from Source

   git clone git@github.com:MatheusDubberstein/h1-h6-tag-tester.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the Extension Directory:

   ```bash
   cd h1-h6-tag-tester
   ```

3. Load the Extension in Chrome:
   â€¢ Follow the installation steps mentioned above.

## Permissions

The extension requests the following permissions:

    - **activeTab**: To interact with the currently active tab.
    - **scripting**: To execute scripts in the context of web pages.
    - **storage**: To save user preferences for custom colors.
    - **webNavigation**: To access information about the frames within a tab.
    - **host_permissions**: <all_urls> to allow the extension to work on all websites.

_Note: The extension respects user privacy and only accesses necessary data to provide its functionality._

## Troubleshooting

### Headings Not Highlighted:

- Ensure that you have reloaded the webpage after installing the extension.
- Check if the page is a Chrome internal page (chrome://), as extensions cannot run on these pages.

### Badge Positioning Issues:

- Some webpages with custom styles may affect badge positioning.
- The extension tries to adjust for most cases, but perfect compatibility cannot be guaranteed.

### Cross-Origin Iframes:

- Due to browser security policies, the extension may not access headings within cross-origin iframes.
- The extension handles this gracefully by processing accessible iframes and informing the user when content cannot be accessed.
